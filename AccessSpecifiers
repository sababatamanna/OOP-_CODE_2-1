There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++: 

Public
Private
Protected


default the access modifier for the members will be Private


 1. Public: All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone. 
 The data members and member functions declared as public can be accessed by other classes and functions too. 
 The public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere in the program using the direct member access 
 operator (.) with the object of that class. 
 
 
 2.Private: The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class. 
 They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object  outside the class. 
 Only the member functions or the friend functions are allowed to access the private data members of the class.
